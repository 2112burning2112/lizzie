# lizzie - Leela Zero Interface
![screenshot](/screen.png?raw=true)

Allows the user to analyze games in realtime using [Leela Zero](www.github.com/gcp/leela-zero). We're currently in beta. You need Java 8 or higher to run this program. Currently only Windows is supported, sorry! This will change soon :)

The first run will take a while because Leelaz needs to set up the OpenCL tunings. Just hang tight, and wait for it to finish, then you will see Leelaz's analysis displayed on the board. Feel free to supply your own tunings, as this will speed up the process. Do this by copying any leelaz_opencl_tuning file you have into the directory.
